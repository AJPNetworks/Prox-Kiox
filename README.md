# Prox-Kiox (version 1.4.1)

## About

### This Project was idealized by a member of the Harvey's Virtual Environment Discord community and brought together by myself.  All credit for the idea goes the HSVE Community.

### Prox-Kiox is simply an install script that will essentially turn any Proxmox intall into a kiosk setup, allowing for full UI managemnt of Proxmox from its main display out.
### It will install a window manager as well as Firefox in order to achieve this by opening a window automatically and placing it in full screen mode after navigating to the correct location, being http://127.0.0.1:8006.

## Installation

### Automatic install

This may not work or may be instable

~sh <(curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AJPNetworks/Prox-Kiox/main/install.sh)~



### WGET Download

Download the install script using wget

``wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AJPNetworks/Prox-Kiox/main/install.sh && chmod +x install.sh``

From here you can look at the usage section below to determine if its necessary to modify the sleep times.
After they have been changed or not you can simply run the script using the following

``./install.sh``



### Manual Install

First, Update the running server with

``apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y``

Next, we need to install the following dependencies

``apt-get install -y openbox firefox-esr xinit``

An easy way to beable to call this script whenever is by creating a bash command
We first need to create the file that houses the script with the following command and then nano into it.

``touch /usr/bin/prox-kiox && nano /usr/bin/prox-kiox``

The following code should be placed in the file

```
#!/bin/bash
if pgrep -x "firefox-esr" >/dev/null; then
    clear
    echo "Priox-Kiox already running"
    return 0
fi

profile_dir=$(find "$HOME/.mozilla/firefox/" -name "*.default-esr" -type d)
if [ -z "$profile_dir" ]; then
    echo ""
    echo "Firefox profile directory not found."
    return 1
fi
prefsfile="$profile_dir/sessionstore-backups"

rm -rf "$prefsfile"/*

mode=""
while [[ $# -gt 0 ]]; do
  case $1 in
    --kiosk)
      mode="kiosk"
      shift
      ;;
    *)
      echo "Invalid option: $1" >&2
      exit 1
      ;;
  esac
  shift
done
nohup startx &
export DISPLAY=:0
while true; do
    result=$(xdpyinfo 2>&1)
    if [[ $result == *"unable to open display"* ]]; then
        echo "Error: Unable to open display"
        sleep 0.25
    else
        echo "X server is running and display is available."
        break
    fi
done

if [[ $mode = kiosk ]]; then
  nohup firefox-esr --kiosk https://127.0.0.1:8006 &
else

  nohup firefox-esr https://127.0.0.1:8006 &
fi
exit $retval
```

We need to ensure it can be ran so we will add execute permissions to it

```chmod +x /user/bin/prox-kiox```

Now its all set up, we can go ahead and run the following to get it started

``prox-kiox``


Now you should be able to see FireFox runing and the PVE webui screen.



## Usage

You can use either of the three methods to install but the most stable is going to be with wget.

After installing, its as simple as running `prox-kiox` in the cli to get it all started.  We can also add `--kiosk` if we want it to be full screen and feel more immersive.



## Uninstall

At any time, you may run the uninstaller script ant it will clean the system of all packages that were installed and remove the autorun file so theres no issues after the fact.  You can do so with the following

``sh <(curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AJPNetworks/Prox-Kiox/main/uninstall.sh)``

Or you may use the wget method as like above but using uninstall.sh instead, like this

Download the install script using wget

``wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AJPNetworks/Prox-Kiox/main/uninstall.sh && chmod +x uninstall.sh``

From here you can look at the usage section below to determine if its necessary to modify the sleep times.
After they have been changed or not you can simply run the script using the following

``./uninstall.sh``

Please not that these scripts do not delete themselves, so you will need to run

``rm /path/to/script/install.sh``
``rm /path/to/script/uninstall.sh``


## Known Issues
